abstract = {Rainwater harvesting, broadly defined as the collection and storage of surface runoff, has a long history in supplying water for agricultural purposes. Despite its significance, rainwater harvesting in small reservoirs has previously been overlooked in large-scale assessments of agricultural water supply and demand. We used a macroscale hydrological model, observed climate data and other physical datasets to explore the potential role of small, localized rainwater harvesting systems in supplying water for irrigated areas. We first estimated the potential contribution of local water harvesting to supply currently irrigated areas. We then explored the potential of supplemental irrigation applied to all cropland areas to increase crop evapotranspiration (or green water flow), using locally stored surface runoff in small reservoirs for different scenarios of installed reservoir capacity. The estimated increase in green water flow varied between 623 and 1122 km3 a-1. We assessed the implications of this increase in green water flows for cereal production by assuming a constant crop water productivity in areas where current levels of crop yield are below global averages. Globally, the supplemental irrigation of existing cropland areas could increase cereal production by ∼35% for a medium variant of reservoir capacity, with large potential increases in Africa and Asia. As small reservoirs can significantly impact the hydrological regime of river basins, we also assessed the impacts of small reservoirs on downstream river flow and quantified evaporation losses from small reservoirs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding stream runoff generation processes requires distributed stream runoff estimates; however the acquisition of such estimates remains challenging in hydrology, especially in remote areas. In regions with a high spatial density of small reservoirs, those reservoirs could be employed to gauge stream runoff (Liebe et al., 2009). Using a water balance approach, the stream runoff flowing into a reservoir from a drainage catchment could be estimated. Accordingly, this work aims to address the following two questions: i) what is the error in the estimated stream runoff and ii) what are the main estimation uncertainty factors? Based on a case study of the Kamech catchment, Tunisia, stream runoff was estimated at different temporal resolutions (1–32 days), and a global sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the contributions of the reservoir water balance terms (evaporation, rainfall, percolation, reservoir water level and level-area-volume relations) to the estimated stream runoff uncertainty. The results reveal that stream runoff can be reliably estimated based on small reservoirs using a mass balance approach. The error and global stream runoff estimation uncertainties decrease as the temporal resolution increases. The bathymetric relationships (level-area and level-volume relations) constitute a strong factor of uncertainty for all temporal resolutions, and even the dominant factor for temporal resolutions ranging from 4 to 23 days. The estimation uncertainty for the shortest temporal resolutions (1–8 days) mainly originates from reservoir level uncertainty. As the temporal resolution increases, the contribution of percolation uncertainty increases. The general (not site-specific) conclusions of this study are that stream runoff gauging based on small reservoirs requires the determination of the bathymetric relations and that small reservoirs could be used as reliable stream runoff gauges at short temporal resolutions if the reservoir level is measured with limited uncertainty and at long temporal resolutions as long as the percolation rate from the reservoir is known with limited uncertainty.},

abstract = {Human activities both aggravate and alleviate streamflow drought. Here we show that aggravation is dominant in contrasting cases around the world analysed with a consistent methodology. Our 28 cases included different combinations of human-water interactions. We found that water abstraction aggravated all drought characteristics, with increases of 20%-305% in total time in drought found across the case studies, and increases in total deficit of up to almost 3000%. Water transfers reduced drought time and deficit by up to 97%. In cases with both abstraction and water transfers into the catchment or augmenting streamflow from groundwater, the water inputs could not compensate for the aggravation of droughts due to abstraction and only shift the effects in space or time. Reservoir releases for downstream water use alleviated droughts in the dry season, but also led to deficits in the wet season by changing flow seasonality. This led to minor changes in average drought duration (-26 to +38%) and moderate changes in average drought deficit (-86 to +369%). Land use showed a smaller impact on streamflow drought, also with both increases and decreases observed (-48 to +98%). Sewage return flows and pipe leakage possibly counteracted the effects of increased imperviousness in urban areas; however, untangling the effects of land use change on streamflow drought is challenging. This synthesis of diverse global cases highlights the complexity of the human influence on streamflow drought and the added value of empirical comparative studies. Results indicate both intended and unintended consequences of water management and infrastructure on downstream society and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Drought management is currently informed by a variety of approaches, mostly responding to drought crisis when it happens. Toward more effective and integrated drought management, we introduce a conceptual drought diagnosis framework inspired by diagnostic concepts from the field of medicine. This framework comprises five steps: 1. Initial diagnostic assessment; 2. Diagnostic testing; 3. Consultation; 4. Communication of the diagnosis; and 5. Treatment and prognosis. To illustrate the need for the proposed approach, four case studies of recently drought-affected regions were selected: the city of Cape Town, the state of California, the Northeast region of Brazil, and the Horn of Africa. Contrasting elements for these cases include the geographic extent and political boundaries, climate, socio-economics, and the relevance of different water resources (e.g., rainfall, reservoirs, and aquifers). For each case, we identified documented practices and policies and reflected on them in terms of drought misdiagnosis or incomplete diagnosis that have aggravated socio-economic and environmental drought impacts. A common example is the preference for technical solutions (e.g., installing infrastructure to augment water supply), rather than measures that reduce vulnerability. Analysis of these four drought case studies confirmed the anticipated need for a comprehensive approach to drought diagnosis for more successful treatment and prevention of drought. Using an analogy with medical science can be helpful toward comprehensively diagnosing droughts for a variety of contexts and assessing the effectiveness of proposed interventions. This framework can help drought managers to be more proactive in enabling drought-affected regions to become more drought resilient in the future.},

Satellite images of semiarid south India are used here to quantify fluctuating water volumes in ∼2500 reservoirs. In this pilot study, the detection of temporal trends and spatial discontinuities in land use at successive dates within reservoir beds is a proxy for assessing the performance of reservoirs and for formulating hypotheses on the environmental, socioeconomic, or anthropological reasons behind the inferred levels of infrastructural maintenance or disuse.

abstract = {Small reservoirs serve many people living in semi-arid environments. Water stored in these reservoirs is used to supplement rainfed agriculture, allow for dry season irrigated agriculture and ensure the availability of water for domestic purposes. In order to manage the water effectively for competing uses, the actual storage of these reservoirs needs to be known. Recent attempts to delineate these reservoirs using remote sensing with Landsat imagery have been successful, especially in the upper east region of Ghana, West Africa. This paper shows that radar images (ENVISAT ASAR) can be used to provide similar information all year-round. Radar images have as an important advantage that they are not impaired by cloud cover and thus can be used during the rainy season. Another advantage of radar images is that images taken during night time are usable. The paper compares satellite derived data with field measurements of 21 small reservoirs. Whereas ENVISAT images on the average tend to overestimate the surface areas of small reservoirs, in certain reservoirs these areas are systematically under-estimated due to the shallow tail-ends of reservoirs that tend to have reed vegetation. These cannot be readily distinguished from the surrounding vegetation outside the reservoirs. This paper therefore provides a proof of concept of the monitoring of small reservoir volumes by radar imagery. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The repetition of droughts in France has led to a growing demand for irrigation water and consequently to an increase in requests for the construction of small farm dams. Although such dams are small, their accumulation in a basin affects river flows, because the water collected in these small farm dams is used for irrigation and thus does not contribute to river flow. In order to gain more insight into their impact on the annual and monthly discharges, especially during dry years, a small farm dam model was built and connected to a hydrometeorological model. Several scenarios with different volume capacities, filling catchment sizes and filling periods were tested for such dams. The results were analysed in a small basin in western France, where the pressure for building such dams is high, and then extended to the entire country. It was found that, due to the hydrometeorological conditions (mainly low precipitation compared to other regions in France), the development of small farm dams in north-western France would result in greater decreases in river flows and less efficient filling of small farm dams than in other regions. Therefore, such dams might not be as efficient as expected in supplying water to farmers when needed. Moreover, the ability to fill small farm dams is projected to decrease in a context of climate change, despite the uncertainty on the evolution of precipitation, thus worsening the situation.},

abstract = {In river basins with water storage facilities, the availability of regularly-updated information on reservoir level and capacity is of paramount importance for the effective management of those systems. Yet, for the vast majority of reservoirs around the world, storage levels are either not measured or not readily available due to financial, political or legal considerations. This paper proposes a novel approach using Landsat imagery and Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to retrieve information on storage variations in inaccessible regions. Unlike existing approaches, the method does not require any in situ measurement 5 and is appropriate to monitor small, and often undocumented, irrigation reservoirs. It consists of three recovery steps: (i) a 2D dynamic classification of Landsat spectral bands information to quantify the surface area of water, (ii) a statistical correction of DEM data to characterize the topography of each reservoir and (iii) a 3D reconstruction algorithm to correct for clouds and Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector failure. The method is applied to quantify reservoir storage in the Yarmouk basin in Southern Syria, where ground monitoring is impeded by the ongoing civil war. It is validated against available in situ measurements in 10 neighboring Jordanian reservoirs. Coefficients of determination range from 0.69 to 0.84, and the average relative error from 3 % to 35 % for storage estimations on six Jordanian reservoirs with maximal water surface areas ranging from 0.59 km 2 to 3.79 km 2 .},

abstract = {The state of the art for optimal water reservoir operations is rapidly evolving, driven by emerging societal challenges. Changing values for balancing environmental resources, multisectoral human system pressures, and more frequent climate extremes are increasing the complexity of operational decision making. Today, reservoir operations benefit from technological advances, including improved monitoring and forecasting systems as well as increasing computational power. Past research in this area has largely focused on improving solution algorithms within the limits of the available computational power, using simplified problem formulations that can misrepresent important systemic complexities and intersectoral interactions. In this study, we review the recent literature focusing on how the operation design problem is formulated, rather than solved, to address existing challenges and take advantage of new opportunities. This paper contributes a comprehensive classification of over 300 studies published over the last years into distinctive categories depending on the adopted problem formulation, which clarifies consolidated methodological approaches and emerging trends. Our analysis also suggests that control policy design methods may benefit from broadening the types of information that is used to condition operational decisions, and from using emulation modeling to identify low-order, computationally efficient surrogate models capturing realistic representations of river basin systems' complexity in order to isolate key decision-relevant processes. These advances in reservoir operations hold significant promise for better addressing the challenges of conflicting human pressures and a changing world, which is particularly important, given the renewed interest in dam construction globally.},

abstract = {The number of small reservoirs has increased due to their reduced cost, the availability of many favourable locations, and their easy access due to proximity. The cumulative impacts of such small reservoirs are not easy to estimate, even when solely considering hydrology, which is partially due to the difficulty in collecting data on the functioning of such reservoirs. However, there is evidence indicating that the cumulative impacts of such reservoirs are significant. The aim of this article is to present a review of the studies that address the cumulative impacts of small reservoirs on hydrology, focusing on the methodology and on the way in which these impacts are assessed. Most of the studies addressing the hydrological cumulative impacts focused on the annual stream discharge, with decreases ranging from 0.2% to 36% with a mean value of 13.4% ± 8% over approximately 30 references. However, it is shown that similar densities of small reservoirs can lead to different impacts on stream discharge in different regions. This result is probably due to the hydro-climatic conditions and makes defining simple indicators to provide a first guess of the cumulative impacts difficult. The impacts also vary in time, with a more intense reduction in the river discharge during the dry years than during the wet years. This finding is certainly an important point to take into consideration in the context of climate change. Two methods are mostly used to estimate cumulative impacts: i) exclusively data-based methods and ii) models. The assumptions, interests and shortcomings of these methods are presented. Scientific tracks are proposed to address the four main shortcomings, namely the estimation of the associated uncertainties, the lack of knowledge on reservoir characteristics and water abstraction and the accuracy of the impact indicators.},

abstract = {In the current human-modified world, or Anthropocene, the state of water stores and fluxes has become dependent on human as well as natural processes. Water deficits (or droughts) are the result of a complex interaction between meteorological anomalies, land surface processes, and human inflows, outflows, and storage changes. Our current inability to adequately analyse and manage drought in many places points to gaps in our understanding and to inadequate data and tools. The Anthropocene requires a new framework for drought definitions and research. Drought definitions need to be revisited to explicitly include human processes driving and modifying soil moisture drought and hydrological drought development. We give recommendations for robust drought definitions to clarify timescales of drought and prevent confusion with related terms such as water scarcity and overexploitation. Additionally, our understanding and analysis of drought need to move from single driver to multiple drivers and from uni-directional to multi-directional. We identify research gaps and propose analysis approaches on (1) drivers, (2) modifiers, (3) impacts, (4) feedbacks, and (5) changing the baseline of drought in the Anthropocene. The most pressing research questions are related to the attribution of drought to its causes, to linking drought impacts to drought characteristics, and to societal adaptation and responses to drought. Example questions include i) What are the dominant drivers of drought in different parts of the world? (ii) How do human modifications of drought enhance or alleviate drought severity? (iii) How do impacts of drought depend on the physical characteristics of drought vs. the vulnerability of people or the environment? (iv) To what extent are physical and human drought processes coupled, and can feedback loops be identified and altered to lessen or mitigate drought? (v) How should we adapt our drought analysis to accommodate changes in the normal situation (i.e. what are considered normal or reference conditions) over time? Answering these questions requires exploration of qualitative and quantitative data as well as mixed modelling approaches. The challenges related to drought research and management in the Anthropocene are not unique to drought, but do require urgent attention. We give recommendations drawn from the fields of flood research, ecology, water management, and water resources studies. The framework presented here provides a holistic view on drought in the Anthropocene, which will help improve management strategies for mitigating the severity and reducing the impacts of droughts in future.},

abstract = {Scarcity of hydrological data, especially streamflow discharge and groundwater level series, restricts the understanding of channel transmission losses (TL) in drylands. Furthermore, the lack of information on spatial river dynamics encompasses high uncertainty on TL analysis in large rivers. The objective of this study was to combine the information from streamflow and groundwater level series with multi-temporal satellite data to derive a hydrological concept of TL for a reach of the Middle Jaguaribe River (MJR) in semi-arid north-eastern Brazil. Based on this analysis, we proposed strategies for its modelling and simulation. TL take place in an alluvium, where river and groundwater can be considered to be hydraulically connected. Most losses certainly infiltrated only through streambed and levees and not through the flood plains, as could be shown by satellite image analysis. TL events whose input river flows were smaller than a threshold did not reach the outlet of the MJR. TL events whose input flows were higher than this threshold reached the outlet losing on average 30% of their input. During the dry seasons (DS) and at the beginning of rainy seasons (DS/BRS), no river flow is expected for pre-events, and events have vertical infiltration into the alluvium. At the middle and the end of the rainy seasons (MRS/ERS), river flow sustained by base flow occurs before/after events, and lateral infiltration into the alluvium plays a major role. Thus, the MJR shifts from being a losing river at DS/BRS to become a losing/gaining (mostly losing) river at MRS/ERS. A model of this system has to include the coupling of river and groundwater flow processes linked by a leakage approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Drought-affected regions often contain high densities of small reservoirs, usually informally built, as drought-coping mechanism. These structures influence socio-hydrological dynamics and have the potential to alter hydrological processes relevant to drought emergence and development. This study aimed to analyze the influence of a high concentration of small reservoirs on the intensification and evolution of drought events. We present an innovative method, which we call “Drought Cycle Analysis”, that tracks the concomitance of precipitation and water storage deficit and associates this with four drought stages: Wet Period, Meteorological drought, Hydro-meteorological drought and Hydrological drought period. The methodology was tested for the Riacho do Sangue River watershed located in the semi-arid region of northeast Brazil. We used a combination of satellite imagery (Landsat 5, 7 and 8) and an empirical equation to estimate the volume stored in the dense network of small reservoirs. Using the Drought Cycle Analysis, we show that the unmonitored small reservoirs induced and modified drought events, extending the duration of hydrological drought on average by 30%. Furthermore, this extension can double for specific drought events. The Drought Cycle Analysis method proved useful for monitoring and comparing the evolution of different drought events, in addition to being applicable as an auxiliary tool in the improvement of water resources management of large reservoirs. This study demonstrates the importance of considering small reservoirs in water resource management strategy development for drought-prone regions.},

abstract = {Small reservoirs have developed across semi-arid areas as a low cost solution for millions of rural small holders to harvest scarce water resources. Studies have highlighted limited agricultural water use and low water availability on individual reservoirs, but no information exists on the drought patterns of multiple small reservoirs. Their small size and dispersion prevents individualised hydrological monitoring, while hydrological modelling suffers from rainfall variability and heterogeneity across data sparse catchments and reservoirs. A semi-automated original approach exploiting free, archive Landsat satellite images is developed here for long-term monitoring of multiple ungauged small water bodies. Adapted and tested against significant hydrometric time series on three lakes, the method confirms its potential to monitor water availability on the smallest water bodies (1–10 ha) with a mean RMSE of 20,600 m3 (NRMSE = 26%). Uncertainties from the absence of site-specific and updated surface-volume rating curves were here contained through a power relationship adapted over time for silting based on data from 15 surrounding lakes. Applied to 51 small reservoirs and 546 images over 1999–2014, results highlight the ability of this transposable method to shed light on flood dynamics and allow inter annual and inter lake comparisons of water availability. In the Merguellil upper catchment, in Central Tunisia, results reveal the significant droughts affecting over 80% of reservoirs, confirming the need for small reservoirs to maintain a supplementary irrigation objective only.},

abstract = {SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) is a comprehensive, semi-distributed river basin model that requires a large number of input parameters, which complicates model parameterization and calibration. Several calibration techniques have been developed for SWAT, including manual calibration procedures and automated procedures using the shuffled complex evolution method and other common methods. In addition, SWAT-CUP was recently developed and provides a decision-making framework that incorporates a semi-automated approach (SUFI2) using both manual and automated calibration and incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. In SWAT-CUP, users can manually adjust parameters and ranges iteratively between autocalibration runs. Parameter sensitivity analysis helps focus the calibration and uncertainty analysis and is used to provide statistics for goodness-of-fit. The user interaction or manual component of the SWAT-CUP calibration forces the user to obtain a better understanding of the overall hydrologic processes (e.g., baseflow ratios, ET, sediment sources and sinks, crop yields, and nutrient balances) and of parameter sensitivity. It is important for future calibration developments to spatially account for hydrologic processes; improve model run time efficiency; include the impact of uncertainty in the conceptual model, model parameters, and measured variables used in calibration; and assist users in checking for model errors. When calibrating a physically based model like SWAT, it is important to remember that all model input parameters must be kept within a realistic uncertainty range and that no automatic procedure can substitute for actual physical knowledge of the watershed.},

abstract = {Climate change is becoming an imminent reality, especially in arid and semiarid regions. Therefore, it is essential to understand the relationships between humans and aquatic ecosystems in order to devise efficient management and conservation strategies. We conducted 126 interviews using a semi-structured form to record water sources, transport strategies, and the use and treatment of water by communities surrounding four reservoirs within two drainage basins in the semiarid region of Brazil. These factors were then compared to the mean water volumes of the respective reservoirs from 2013 to 2015, a period of severe drought in that area. Seven types of water sources were considered, according to the perspectives of the interviewees: large reservoirs (dams) (43% of the citations), other smaller reservoirs (25%), rainwater (17.5%), wells (7%), waterholes (3%), bottled water (4%), and water tanks (0.5%). The water resources obtained are transported to human residences in seven different manners: actively pumped (34% of the citations), by water tanker truck (33%), distributed in pipes by local resident associations (11%), transport by animal (14%), human transport (4%), by car (2%), and by motorcycle (2%). The water is then used for domestic purposes (21%), for personal hygiene (20%), by animals (19%), in agriculture (18%), for cooking (10%), for fishing (7%), and for drinking (6%). A worrisome trend was that many local residents did not treat the water they were consuming. Climate change affects seasonal patterns of rainfall that will, in turn, determine the availability and quantities of water resources, provoking changes in the sources of water used by human populations, their strategies of access to that resource, and water-use patterns. It is necessary sustainable use of water resources based on the realities of local populations.},

Quantification of natural water availability and of water use are key issues within a comprehensive Brazilian-German research project.

The model subdivides the area into administrative sub-units (municipalities) of in average about 1000 km2, and uses daily time-steps. The hydrological module is designed to account for: water availability (in terms of river runoff, reservoir storage, groundwater recharge and soil moisture), influence of climate and land-use changes on water balance, large spatial scale (acknowledging the uncertainty of model results in view of scarce data), and specific semi-arid hydroclimatological conditions. This version of the water use module includes domestic, animal and irrigation water uses. The withdrawal water use and consumptive water use can approximately be calculated for the present situation of the municipalities.

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

In some regions the economic growth has led to a level of water demand that can only be accomplished through efficient reservoir networks. Such infrastructures are not always planned at larger scale but rather made by farmers according to their local needs of irrigation during droughts. Based on extensive data from the upper Jaguaribe basin, one of the world's largest system of reservoirs, located in the Brazilian semiarid northeast, we reveal that surprisingly it self-organizes into a scale-free network exhibiting also a power-law in the distribution of the lakes and avalanches of discharges. With a new self-organized-criticality-type model we manage to explain the novel critical exponents.

abstract = {A freely available dataset produced from three million Landsat satellite images reveals substantial changes in the distribution of global surface water over the past 32 years and their causes, from climate change to human actions. The distribution of surface water has been mapped globally, and local-to-regional studies have tracked changes over time. But to date, there has been no global and methodologically consistent quantification of changes in surface water over time. Jean-Fran{\c{c}}ois Pekel and colleagues have analysed more than three million Landsat images to quantify month-to-month changes in surface water at a resolution of 30 metres and over a 32-year period. They find that surface waters have declined by almost 90,000 square kilometres—largely in the Middle East and Central Asia—but that surface waters equivalent to about twice that area have been created elsewhere. Drought, reservoir creation and water extraction appear to have driven most of the changes in surface water over the past decades. The location and persistence of surface water (inland and coastal) is both affected by climate and human activity1 and affects climate2,3, biological diversity4 and human wellbeing5,6. Global data sets documenting surface water location and seasonality have been produced from inventories and national descriptions7, statistical extrapolation of regional data8 and satellite imagery9,10,11,12, but measuring long-term changes at high resolution remains a challenge. Here, using three million Landsat satellite images13, we quantify changes in global surface water over the past 32 years at 30-metre resolution. We record the months and years when water was present, where occurrence changed and what form changes took in terms of seasonality and persistence. Between 1984 and 2015 permanent surface water has disappeared from an area of almost 90,000 square kilometres, roughly equivalent to that of Lake Superior, though new permanent bodies of surface water covering 184,000 square kilometres have formed elsewhere. All continental regions show a net increase in permanent water, except Oceania, which has a fractional (one per cent) net loss. Much of the increase is from reservoir filling, although climate change14 is also implicated. Loss is more geographically concentrated than gain. Over 70 per cent of global net permanent water loss occurred in the Middle East and Central Asia, linked to drought and human actions including river diversion or damming and unregulated withdrawal15,16. Losses in Australia17 and the USA18 linked to long-term droughts are also evident. This globally consistent, validated data set shows that impacts of climate change and climate oscillations on surface water occurrence can be measured and that evidence can be gathered to show how surface water is altered by human activities. We anticipate that this freely available data will improve the modelling of surface forcing, provide evidence of state and change in wetland ecotones (the transition areas between biomes), and inform water-management decision-making.},

@article{Oldeman1993,
abstract = {The soil is a natural resource, non renewable in the short term or very difficult to renew and expensive either to reclaim or to improve following erosion, physical degradation or chemical pollution. The increasing pressure on land and water resources, leading to degradation and pollution of those resources, and a reduced productive capacity calls for a system which can store detailed information on natural resources of all kinds in such a way that these data can be accessed, combined and analyzed from the point of view of potential use, in relation to food requirements, environmental impact and conservation. Such a system is a prerequisite for policy formulation, development planning at all levels, efficient use of both internal and external resources, and for implementation of development programmes. In a typical case such a system would consist of: 1. (1) A computerised database containing all available information on topography, soils, climate, vegetation and land use. It should be complemented with compatible databases of socio-economic factors. 2. (2) Geographical Information System or GIS, which links each item of information to its precise geographical location, but which can display each type of information as a separate layer, or overlay. 3. (3) A set of crop yield models which can calculate the level of production which could be obtained from each and any combination of soil and climate in the region or country, at a number of different input levels or management systems. 4. (4) Various environmental impact models, which, for example, allow the calculation of rates of erosion for a given land unit, use, and production system. Development of computerized natural resource inventory and land evaluation systems especially for use in developing countries has been carried out by FAO since the early nineteen-seventies, notably under the Agro-Ecological Zones programme. In 1987, the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC), based in Wageningen, the Netherlands, undertook at the request of UNEP and in close cooperation with the ISSS, FAO and the Land Resources Research Centre in Canada, to develop a Methodology for a World Soils and Terrain Digital Database (SOTER). This land resource information system was tested in three pilot areas involving five countries (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, USA and Canada), using local data and training national staff in operation. Though further up-grading and improvement will continue, this system can now be established as an almost routine operation which mainly involves the provision of equipment, and training. Most developing countries are quite acutely aware of the need, and many are already attempting to establish computerised natural resource databases of one kind or another. Furthermore, all donors and aid agencies, particularly those such as the World Bank, which seek comprehensive solutions, will TIF become aware that such systems are an essential tool for development, and are also very cheap in comparative terms. A long term commitment from these agencies is needed so that SOTER can rapidly provide the key soil and terrain attributes, which are needed to assess the potential productivity of the land, the status, risk and rate of soil degradation, to develop action to conserve or rehabilitate the land, and to improve our understanding in global change. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The findings of hydrological modeling studies depend on which model was used. Although hydrological model selection is a crucial step, experience suggests that hydrologists tend to stick to the model they have experience with, and rarely switch to competing models, although these models might be more adequate given the study objectives. To gain quantitative insights into model selection, we explored the use of seven rainfall-runoff models based on the abstract of 1,529 peer-reviewed papers published between 1991 and 2018. The models selected were the Hydrologiska Byr{\aa}ns Vattenbalansavdelning model (HBV), the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC), the mesoscale Hydrological model (mHM), the TOPography-based hydrologic model (TOPMODEL), the Precipitation Runoff Modelling System (PRMS), the G{\'{e}}nie Rural model {\`{a}} 4 param{\`{e}}tres Journaliers (GR4J), and the Sacramento soil moisture accounting model. We provide quantitative evidence of regional preferences in model use across the world and demonstrate that specific models are consistently preferred by certain institutes. Model attachment is particularly strong. In $\sim$74% of the studies, the model selected can be predicted solely based on the affiliation of the first author. The influence of adequacy on the model selection process is less clear. Our data reveal that each model is used across a wide range of purposes, landscapes, and temporal and spatial scales (i.e., as a model of everything and everywhere). Model intercomparisons can provide guidance for model selection and improve model adequacy, but they are still rare (because each model must usually be setup individually) and the insights they provide are currently limited (because they are rarely controlled experiments). We suggest that moving from fixed-structure models to modular modeling frameworks (master templates for model generation) can overcome these issues, enable a more collaborative and responsive model development environment, and result in improved model adequacy.},

abstract = {Building reservoirs is a response to cope with drought in drylands. However, this human modification to the landscape may trigger both positive and negative effects. Here, we investigate how a network of reservoirs influences the propagation of meteorological drought (MD) into hydrological drought (HD) in a large semi-arid catchment in Brazil. We applied 12-month standardized indices to classify droughts. Then, the drought series were compared to each other. The downstreamness concept was used to describe the spatial water distribution. The onset of reservoir drought (RD) was much later than MD, but the delay between MD and RD peaks was even longer. Streamflow drought started with a small delay after MD, but it transformed into a similar RD. RD was initially more severe downstream. When the drought severity was at its highest, upstream and downstream RD equalized. The perceptual model of drought propagation may help in developing reservoir management systems in drylands.

abstract = {Keywords: Coordinated reservoir operation Coupled hydrologic/hydrodynamic modeling Flood Large scale Multi-criteria performance evaluation Danube s u m m a r y The coordinated operation of reservoirs in large-scale river basins has great potential to improve flood mitigation. However, this requires large scale hydrological models to translate the effect of reservoir operation to downstream points of interest, in a quality sufficient for the iterative development of optimized operation strategies. And, of course, it requires reservoirs large enough to make a noticeable impact. In this paper, we present and discuss several methods dealing with these prerequisites for reservoir operation using the example of three major floods in the Bavarian Danube basin (45,000 km 2) and nine reservoirs therein: We start by presenting an approach for multi-criteria evaluation of model performance during floods, including aspects of local sensitivity to simulation quality. Then we investigate the potential of joint hydrologic-2d-hydrodynamic modeling to improve model performance. Based on this, we evaluate upper limits of reservoir impact under idealized conditions (perfect knowledge of future rainfall) with two methods: Detailed simulations and statistical analysis of the reservoirs' specific retention volume. Finally, we investigate to what degree reservoir operation strategies optimized for local (downstream vicinity to the reservoir) and regional (at the Danube) points of interest are compatible. With respect to model evaluation, we found that the consideration of local sensitivities to simulation quality added valuable information not included in the other evaluation criteria (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and Peak timing). With respect to the second question, adding hydrodynamic models to the model chain did, contrary to our expectations, not improve simulations, despite the fact that under idealized conditions (using observed instead of simulated lateral inflow) the hydrodynamic models clearly outperformed the routing schemes of the hydrological models. Apparently, the advantages of hydrodynamic models could not be fully exploited when fed by output from hydrological models afflicted with systematic errors in volume and timing. This effect could potentially be reduced by joint calibration of the hydrological-hydrodynamic model chain. Finally, based on the combination of the simulation-based and statistical impact assessment, we identified one reservoir potentially useful for coordinated, regional flood mitigation for the Danube. While this finding is specific to our test basin, the more interesting and generally valid finding is that operation strategies optimized for local and regional flood mitigation are not necessarily mutually exclusive, sometimes they are identical, sometimes they can, due to temporal offsets, be pursued simultaneously.},

abstract = {Robust decision-making is being increasingly used to support environmental resources decisions and policy analysis under changing climate and society. In this context, a robust decision is a decision that is as much as possible insensitive to a large degree of uncertainty and ensures certain performance across multiple plausible futures. Yet, the concept of robustness is neither unique nor static. Multiple robustness metrics, such as maximin, optimism-pessimism, max regret, have been proposed in the literature, reflecting diverse optimistic/pessimistic attitudes by the decision maker. Further, these attitudes can evolve in time as a response to sequences of favorable (or adverse) events, inducing possible dynamic changes in the robustness metrics. In this paper, we explore the impact of alternative definitions of robustness and their evolution in time for a case of water resources system management under changing climate. We study the decisions of the Lake Como operator, who is called to regulate the lake by balancing irrigation supply and flood control, under an ensemble of climate change scenarios. Results show a considerable variability in the system performance across multiple robustness metrics. In fact, the mis-definition of the actual decision maker's attitude biases the simulation of its future decisions and produces a general underestimation of the system performance. The analysis of the dynamic evolution of the decision maker's preferences further confirms the potentially strong impact of changing robustness definition on the decision-making outcomes. Climate change impact assessment studies should therefore include the definition of robustness among the uncertain parameters of the problem in order to analyze future human decisions under uncertainty.},

@article{Herman2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers. Water systems planners have long recognized the need for robust solutions capable of withstanding deviations from the conditions for which they were designed. Robustness analyses have shifted from expected utility to exploratory bottom-up approaches which identify vulnerable scenarios prior to assigning likelihoods. Examples include Robust Decision Making (RDM), Decision Scaling, Info-Gap, and Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM). We propose a taxonomy of robustness frameworks to compare and contrast these approaches based on their methods of (1) alternative generation, (2) sampling of states of the world, (3) quantification of robustness measures, and (4) sensitivity analysis to identify important uncertainties. Building from the proposed taxonomy, we use a regional urban water supply case study in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina to illustrate the decision-relevant consequences that emerge from each of these choices. Results indicate that the methodological choices in the taxonomy lead to the selection of substantially different planning alternatives, underscoring the importance of an informed definition of robustness. Moreover, the results show that some commonly employed methodological choices and definitions of robustness can have undesired consequences when ranking decision alternatives. For the demonstrated test case, recommendations for overcoming these issues include: (1) decision alternatives should be searched rather than prespecified, (2) dominant uncertainties should be discovered through sensitivity analysis rather than assumed, and (3) a carefully elicited multivariate satisficing measure of robustness allows stakeholders to achieve their problem-specific performance requirements. This work emphasizes the importance of an informed problem formulation for systems facing challenging performance tradeoffs and provides a common vocabulary to link the robustness frameworks widely used in the field of water systems planning.},

abstract = {Current soil erosion and reservoir sedimentation modelling at the meso-scale is still faced with intrinsic problems with regard to open scaling questions, data demand, computational efficiency and deficient implementations of retention and re-mobilisation processes for the river and reservoir networks. To overcome some limitations of current modelling approaches, the semi-process-based, spatially semi-distributed modelling framework WASA-SED (Vers. 1) was developed for water and sediment transport in large dryland catchments. The WASA-SED model simulates the runoff and erosion processes at the hillslope scale, the transport and retention processes of suspended and bedload fluxes in the river reaches and the retention and remobilisation processes of sediments in reservoirs. The modelling tool enables the evaluation of management options both for sustainable land-use change scenarios to reduce erosion in the headwater catchments as well as adequate reservoir management options to lessen sedimentation in large reservoirs and reservoir networks. The model concept, its spatial discretisation scheme and the numerical components of the hillslope, river and reservoir processes are described and a model application for the meso-scale dryland catchment Is{\'{a}}bena in the Spanish Pre-Pyrenees (445 km2) is presented to demonstrate the capabilities, strengths and limits of the model framework. The example application showed that the model was able to reproduce runoff and sediment transport dynamics of highly erodible headwater badlands, the transient storage of sediments in the dryland river system, the bed elevation changes of the 93 hm3 Barasona reservoir due to sedimentation as well as the life expectancy of the reservoir under different management options.},

abstract = {In hydrological models, parameters are used to represent the time-invariant characteristics of catchments and to capture different aspects of hydrological response. Hence, model parameters need to be identified based on their role in controlling the hydrological behaviour. For the identification of meaningful parameter values, multiple and complementary performance criteria are used that compare modelled and measured discharge time series. The reliability of the identification of hydrologically meaningful model parameter values depends on how distinctly a model parameter can be assigned to one of the performance criteria.<br><br> To investigate this, we introduce the new concept of connective strength between model parameters and performance criteria. The connective strength assesses the intensity in the interrelationship between model parameters and performance criteria in a bijective way. In our analysis of connective strength, model simulations are carried out based on a latin hypercube sampling. Ten performance criteria including Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and its three components (alpha, beta and r) as well as RSR (the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation) for different segments of the flow duration curve (FDC) are calculated.<br><br> With a joint analysis of two regression tree (RT) approaches, we derive how a model parameter is connected to different performance criteria. At first, RTs are constructed using each performance criterion as the target variable to detect the most relevant model parameters for each performance criterion. Secondly, RTs are constructed using each parameter as the target variable to detect which performance criteria are impacted by changes in the values of one distinct model parameter. Based on this, appropriate performance criteria are identified for each model parameter.<br><br> In this study, a high bijective connective strength between model parameters and performance criteria is found for low- A nd mid-flow conditions. Moreover, the RT analyses emphasise the benefit of an individual analysis of the three components of KGE and of the FDC segments. Furthermore, the RT analyses highlight under which conditions these performance criteria provide insights into precise parameter identification. Our results show that separate performance criteria are required to identify dominant parameters on low- A nd mid-flow conditions, whilst the number of required performance criteria for high flows increases with increasing process complexity in the catchment. Overall, the analysis of the connective strength between model parameters and performance criteria using RTs contribute to a more realistic handling of parameters and performance criteria in hydrological modelling.},

abstract = {Water resource is required for agricultural, industrial, and domestic activities and for environmental preservation. However, with the increase in population and growth of urbanization, industrialization, and commercial activities, planning and management of water resources have become a challenging task to meet various water demands globally. Information and data on streamflow hydrology are, thus, crucial for this purpose. However, availability of measured flow data in many cases is either inadequate or not available at all. When there is no gauging station available at the site of interest, various empirical methods are generally used to estimate the flow there and the best estimation is chosen. This study is focused on the estimation of monthly average flows by such methods popular in Nepal and assessment of how they compare with the results of hydrological simulation. Performance evaluation of those methods was made with a newly introduced index, Global Performance Index (GPI) utilizing six commonly used goodness-of-fit parameters viz. coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, root mean square error, percentage of volume bias, Nash Sutcliff Efficiency and Kling-Gupta Efficiency. This study showed that hydrological modeling is the best among the considered methods of flow estimation for ungauged catchments.},

abstract = {A traditional metric used in hydrology to summarize model performance is the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). Increasingly an alternative metric, the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), is used instead. When NSE is used, NSE = 0 corresponds to using the mean flow as a benchmark predictor. The same reasoning is applied in various studies that use KGE as a metric: negative KGE values are viewed as bad model performance, and only positive values are seen as good model performance. Here we show that using the mean flow as a predictor does not result in KGE=0, but instead KGE = 1- √ 2 ∼ -0:41. Thus, KGE values greater than -0:41 indicate that a model improves upon the mean flow benchmark - even if the model's KGE value is negative. NSE and KGE values cannot be directly compared, because their relationship is non-unique and depends in part on the coefficient of variation of the observed time series. Therefore, modellers who use the KGE metric should not let their understanding of NSE values guide them in interpreting KGE values and instead develop new understanding based on the constitutive parts of the KGE metric and the explicit use of benchmark values to compare KGE scores against. More generally, a strong case can be made for moving away from ad hoc use of aggregated efficiency metrics and towards a framework based on purpose-dependent evaluation metrics and benchmarks that allows for more robust model adequacy assessment.},

abstract = {Irrigation water is one of the most substantial water uses worldwide. Thus, global simulation studies about water availability and demand typically include irrigation. Nowadays, regional scale is of major interest for water resources management but irrigation lacks attention in many catchment modelling studies. This study evaluated the performance of the agro-hydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) for simulating streamflow, evapotranspiration and irrigation in four catchments of different agro-climatic zones at meso-scale (Baitarani/India: Subtropical monsoon; Ilmenau/Germany: Humid; Itata/Chile: Mediterranean; Thubon/Vietnam: Tropical). The models were calibrated well with Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) varying from 0.74–0.89 and percentage bias (PBIAS) from 5.66–6.43%. The simulated irrigation is higher when irrigation is triggered by soil-water deficit compared to plant-water stress. The simulated irrigation scheduling scenarios showed that a significant amount of water can be saved by applying deficit irrigation (25–48%) with a small reduction in annual average crop yield (0–3.3%) in all climatic zones. Many catchments with a high share of irrigated agriculture are located in developing countries with a low availability of input data. For that reason, the application of uncorrected and bias-corrected National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and ERA-interim (ERA) reanalysis data was evaluated for all model scenarios. The simulated streamflow under bias-corrected climate variables is close to the observed streamflow with ERA performing better than NCEP. However, the deviation in simulated irrigation between observed and reanalysis climate varies from −25.5–45.3%, whereas the relative irrigation water savings by deficit irrigation could be shown by all climate input data. The overall variability in simulated irrigation requirement depends mainly on the climate input data. Studies about irrigation requirement in data scarce areas must address this in particular when using reanalysis data.},

These systems appear not to be of local origin. Rainfall is shown to be inversely correlated with the regional subsidence. An interesting and previously unknown diurnal rainfall variation is found. Orographic influences appear to act to modulate the weather systems and develop upslope and downslope winds. This produces rainfall in the morning over the lowland regions and in the afternoon over the hills and more elevated regions.

abstract = {This study aimed to estimate levels of return of extreme daily precipitation events, associating them with natural disasters in Northeast Brazil (NEB), a region characterized by different climatic conditions and low rates of social and economic development. For this, generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) models were adjusted to the daily extreme precipitation data estimated by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 product of the multi-satellite precipitation analysis for a period of 16 years (2000-2015). In addition, the estimates of the GPD model were compared using two data sources, TRMM and pluviometer. The investigation showed that the results of the GPD model estimated by means of the extreme data from the rain gauge and the TRMM were statistically the same, with 95% confidence. Thus, using the data referring to the 2,082 grid points of the TRMM, it was possible to map the spatial distribution of the estimates of the levels of return of extreme precipitation to the return periods of 2, 5 and 10 years, per seasonal period. In general, the results indicated that the intensity of expected extreme precipitation depends on the seasonal period and the place of occurrence of precipitation. The eastern NEB stood out as the region where the highest intensities of extreme precipitation are expected. Extreme precipitation values of up to 178 mm are expected in 2 years. The areas where natural disasters occurred in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 are similar to those in which the highest rainfall intensities are expected. The results of this study can allow the evaluation of the spatial distribution of risks related to extreme precipitation events, and therefore, support the planning of regional public policies and environmental management for the prevention of natural disasters in NEB.},

Therefore, accurate statistical determination of data to find outliers is very important. In the present work, data related to maximum daily rainfall obtained from 12 rain gauge stations belonging to Regional Water Corporation of Ardebil Province inside and around Baliglichay watershed basin were used. Five methods for outlier detection (namely 3×SD±M, Box-Whisker Plot, American Water Resources Association, Grubbs' Test, and Mahalanobis Distance) were adopted. After detecting outliers by the mentioned methods, three control stations were considered in terms of distance, location, and climate. The control stations consisted of 9 rain gauge stations for regional water and 5 meteorological rain gauge stations. Afterwards, outliers in each station were controlled by simultaneous data achieved from the control stations through the five mentioned methods. The results obtained from the present study revealed that only 5 out of 14 outliers detected in 3 out of 7 stations were confirmed. Furthermore, comparison of performance of the methods showed that American Water Resources Association and 3×SD±M methods were more efficient to detect outliers while Mahalanobis Distance had the lowest efficiency.},

Due to the limitations of current data mining techniques, new techniques to handle this data need to be developed. We propose a spatio-temporal outlier detection algorithm called Outstretch, which discovers the outlier movement patterns of the top-k spatial outliers over several time periods. The top-k spatial outliers are found using the Exact-Grid Top- k and Approx-Grid Top- k algorithms, which are an extension of algorithms developed by Agarwal et al. [1]. Since they use the Kulldorff spatial scan statistic, they are capable of discovering all outliers, unaffected by neighbouring regions that may contain missing values. After generating the outlier sequences, we show one way they can be interpreted, by comparing them to the phases of the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscilliation (ENSO) weather phenomenon to provide a meaningful analysis of the results. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

For Gaussian or symmetric distributions, the chance of data occurring outside of the standard boxplot fence is only 0.7%. However, for skewed data, such as telemetric rain observations in a real-time flood forecasting system, the probability is significantly higher. To overcome this problem, a medcouple (MC) that is robust to resisting outliers and sensitive to detecting skewness was introduced to construct a new robust skewed boxplot fence. Three types of boxplot fences related to MC were analyzed and compared, and the exponential function boxplot fence was selected. Operating on uncontaminated as well as simulated contaminated data, the results showed that the proposed method could produce a lower swamping rate and higher accuracy than the standard boxplot and semi-interquartile range boxplot. The outcomes of this study demonstrated that it is reasonable to use the new robust skewed boxplot method to detect outliers in skewed rain distributions.},

abstract = {This article proposes a simulation-based method to adjust functional boxplots for correlations when visualizing functional and spatio-temporal data, as well as detecting outliers. We start by investigating the relationship between the spatio-temporal dependence and the 1.5 times the 50% central region empirical outlier detection rule. Then, we propose to simulate observations without outliers on the basis of a robust estimator of the covariance function of the data. We select the constant factor in the functional boxplot to control the probability of correctly detecting no outliers. Finally, we apply the selected factor to the functional boxplot of the original data. As applications, the factor selection procedure and the adjusted functional boxplots are demonstrated on sea surface temperatures, spatio-temporal precipitation and general circulation model (GCM) data. The outlier detection performance is also compared before and after the factor adjustment. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Modelers can improve a model by addressing the causes for the model errors (data errors and structural errors). This leads to implementing model enhancements (MEs), for example, meteorological data based on more monitoring stations, improved calibration data, and/or modifications in process formulations. However, deciding on which MEs to implement remains a matter of expert knowledge. After implementing multiple MEs, any improvement in model performance is not easily attributed, especially when considering different objectives or aspects of this improvement (e.g., better dynamics vs. reduced bias). We present an approach for comparing the effect of multiple MEs based on real observations and considering multiple objectives (MMEMO). A stepwise selection approach and structured plots help to address the multidimensionality of the problem. Tailored analyses allow a differentiated view on the effect of MEs and their interactions. MMEMO is applied to a case study employing the mesoscale hydro-sedimentological model WASA-SED for the Mediterranean-mountainous Is{\'{a}}bena catchment, northeast Spain. The investigated seven MEs show diverse effects: some MEs (e.g., rainfall data) cause improvements for most objectives, while other MEs (e.g., land use data) only affect a few objectives or even decrease model performance. Interaction of MEs was observed for roughly half of the MEs, confirming the need to address them in the analysis. Calibration and increasing the temporal resolution showed by far stronger impact than any of the other MEs. The proposed framework can be adopted in other studies to analyze the effect of MEs and, thus, facilitate the identification and implementation of the most promising MEs for comparable cases.},

Results show that storage capacity was reduced by 0.2% year-1 due to silting, that the risk of water shortage almost doubled in less than 50 years for the most critical reservoir, and that reduction of storage capacity had three times more impact on yield reduction than the increase in evaporation. Average 90% reliable yield-volume elasticity was 0.8, which means that the global water yield (Q90) in Cear{\'{a}} is expected to diminish yearly by 388 L s-1 due to reservoir silting.

abstract = {Climate change impacts on water availability and hydrological extremes are major concerns as regards the Sustainable Development Goals. Impacts on hydrology are normally investigated as part of a modelling chain, in which climate projections from multiple climate models are used as inputs to multiple impact models, under different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, which result in different amounts of global temperature rise. While the goal is generally to investigate the relevance of changes in climate for the water cycle, water resources or hydrological extremes, it is often the case that variations in other components of the model chain obscure the effect of climate scenario variation. This is particularly important when assessing the impacts of relatively lower magnitudes of global warming, such as those associated with the aspirational goals of the Paris Agreement. In our study, we use ANOVA (analyses of variance) to allocate and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in the hydrological impact modelling chain. In turn we determine the statistical significance of different sources of uncertainty. We achieve this by using a set of five climate models and up to 13 hydrological models, for nine large scale river basins across the globe, under four emissions scenarios. The impact variable we consider in our analysis is daily river discharge. We analyze overall water availability and flow regime, including seasonality, high flows and low flows. Scaling effects are investigated by separately looking at discharge generated by global and regional hydrological models respectively. Finally, we compare our results with other recently published studies. We find that small differences in global temperature rise associated with some emissions scenarios have mostly significant impacts on river discharge-however, climate model related uncertainty is so large that it obscures the sensitivity of the hydrological system.},

abstract = {In this paper, a hydrologic/hydrodynamic modeling of the Amazon River basin is presented using the MGB-IPH model with a validation using remotely sensed observations. Moreover, the sources of model errors by means of the validation and sensitivity tests are investigated, and the physical functioning of the Amazon basin is also explored. The MGB-IPH is a physically based model resolving all land hydrological processes and here using a full 1-D river hydrodynamic module with a simple floodplain storage model. River-floodplain geometry parameters were extracted from the SRTM digital elevation model, and the model was forced using satellite-derived rainfall from TRMM3B42. Model results agree with observed in situ daily river discharges and water levels and with three complementary satellite-based products: (1) water levels derived from ENVISAT altimetry data; (2) a global data set of monthly inundation extent; and (3) monthly terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experimental mission. However, the model is sensitive to precipitation forcing and river-floodplain parameters. Most of the errors occur in westerly regions, possibly due to the poor quality of TRMM 3B42 rainfall data set in these mountainous and/or poorly monitored areas. In addition, uncertainty in river-floodplain geometry causes errors in simulated water levels and inundation extent, suggesting the need for improvement of parameter estimation methods. Finally, analyses of Amazon hydrological processes demonstrate that surface waters govern most of the Amazon TWS changes (56%), followed by soil water (27%) and ground water (8%). Moreover, floodplains play a major role in stream flow routing, although backwater effects are also important to delay and attenuate flood waves. {\textcopyright}2013. American Geophysical Union.

abstract = {<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Providing reliable estimates of streamflow and hydrological fluxes is a major challenge for water resources management over national and transnational basins in South America. Global hydrological models and land surface models are a possible solution to simulate the terrestrial water cycle at the continental scale, but issues on parameterization and limitations in representing lowland river systems put into question their utility for basin-scale analysis and to deliver daily discharges to meet local needs. In an attempt to overcome such limitations, we extended a regional, fully coupled hydrologic–hydrodynamic model (MGB) to the continental domain of South America and assessed its performance using daily river discharges, water levels from independent sources (in situ, satellite altimetry), estimates of terrestrial water storage (TWS) and evapotranspiration (ET) from remote sensing and other available global datasets. In addition, river discharges were compared with outputs from global models acquired through the eartH2Observe project (HTESSEL/CaMa-Flood, LISFLOOD and WaterGAP3), providing the first cross-scale assessment (regional/continental<span class="thinspace"></span>&times;<span class="thinspace"></span>global models) that makes use of spatially consistent daily discharge data. A satisfactory representation of discharges and water levels was obtained (NSE<span class="thinspace"></span>><span class="thinspace"></span>0.6 in 55<span class="thinspace"></span>% of the cases) and MGB was able to capture patterns of seasonality and magnitude of TWS and ET especially over the largest basins of South America. Continental-scale modeling significantly improved discharge estimates when compared with global models, which resulted in a large number of gauges with negative (or close to 0) NSE values. Models were largely affected by positive bias mainly over East/Northeast Brazil and Argentina as well as over regions of Sao Francisco and Parnaiba basins, while major issues on flow timing were observed in regions affected by floodplain processes such as the Amazon, La Plata, Tocantins–Araguaia, Orinoco and Magdalena basins. We state that efforts in calibrating rainfall-runoff parameters within large basins are necessary to simulate daily river discharges appropriately in this continent, but implementing a hydrodynamic routing component is also important. We hope that our study provides further insights about hydrological simulation in South America, helping to reduce the gap between global and regional hydrological modeling communities.</p>},

abstract = {Recent developments in hydrological modelling of river basins are focused on prediction in ungauged basins, which implies the need to improve relationships between model parameters and easily-obtainable information, such as satellite images, and to test the transferability of model parameters. A large-scale distributed hydrological model is described, which has been used in several large river basins in Brazil. The model parameters are related to classes of physical characteristics, such as soil type, land use, geology and vegetation. The model uses two basin space units: square grids for flow direction along the basin and GRU - group response units - which are hydrological classes of the basin physical characteristics for water balance. Expected ranges of parameter values are associated with each of these classes during the model calibration. Results are presented of the model fitting in the Taquari-Antas River basin in Brazil (26 000 km2 and 11 flow gauges). Based on this fitting, the model was then applied to the Upper Uruguay River basin (52 000 km2), having similar physical conditions, without any further calibration, in order to test the transferability of the model. The results in the Uruguay basin were compared with recorded flow data and showed relatively small errors, although a tendency to underestimate mean flows was found.

Droughts affect more people than any other natural hazard owing to their large scale and long-lasting nature. They are recurrent in the region and while some measures have been taken by the governments to mitigate their impacts, there is still a perception that residents, mainly in rural areas, are not yet adapted to these hazards. The drought affecting the Northeast from 2012 to 2015, however, has had an intensity and impact not seen in several decades and has already destroyed large swaths of cropland, affecting hundreds of cities and towns across the region, and leaving ranchers struggling to feed and water cattle. Future climate projections for the area show large temperature increases and rainfall reductions, which, together with a tendency for longer periods with consecutive dry days, suggest the occurrence of more frequent/intense dry spells and droughts and a tendency toward aridification in the region. All these conditions lead to an increase in evaporation from reservoirs and lakes, affecting irrigation and agriculture as well as key water uses including hydropower and industry, and thus, the welfare of the residents. Integrating drought monitoring and seasonal forecasting provides efficient means of assessing impacts of climate variability and change, identifying vulnerabilities, and allowing for better adaptation measures not only for medium- and long-term climate change but also for extremes of the interannual climate variability, particularly droughts.},

abstract = {Based on Climatic Research Unit Time Series 3.1 temperature and Global Precipitation Climatology Center full data reanalysis version 6 precipitation data, the abilities of climate models from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project to simulate climate changes over arid and semiarid areas were assessed. Simulations of future climate changes under different representative concentration pathways (RCPs) were also examined. The key findings were that most of the models are able to capture the dominant features of the spatiotemporal changes in temperature, especially the geographic distribution, during the past 60 years, both globally as well as over arid and semiarid areas. In addition, the models can reproduce the observed warming trends, but with magnitudes generally less than the observations of around 0.1-0.3 °C/50a. Compared to temperature, the models perform worse in simulating the annual evolution of observed precipitation, underestimating both the variability and tendency, and there is a huge spread among the models in terms of their simulated precipitation results. The multi-model ensemble mean is overall superior to any individual model in reproducing the observed climate changes. In terms of future climate change, an ongoing warming projected by the multi-model ensemble over arid and semiarid areas can clearly be seen under different RCPs, especially under the high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), which is twice that of the moderate scenario (RCP4.5). Unlike the increasing temperature, precipitation changes vary across areas and are more significant under high-emission RCPs, with more precipitation over wet areas but less precipitation over dry areas. In particular, northern China is projected to be one of the typical areas experiencing significantly increased temperature and precipitation in the future. {\textcopyright} 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The expansion of reservoirs to cope with droughts and water shortages is hotly debated in many places around the world. We argue that there are two counterintuitive dynamics that should be considered in this debate: supply–demand cycles and reservoir effects. Supply–demand cycles describe instances where increasing water supply enables higher water demand, which can quickly offset the initial benefits of reservoirs. Reservoir effects refer to cases where over-reliance on reservoirs increases vulnerability, and therefore increases the potential damage caused by droughts. Here we illustrate these counterintuitive dynamics with global and local examples, and discuss policy and research implications.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper reports the application of information acquired by aerial survey to characterize water supply reservoirs in the Paje{\'{u}} River Basin (Pernambuco State/Brazil). The survey was carried out with digital cameras of high spatial resolution and laser relief profiling (LiDAR technology). Two areas were selected to apply the remote sensing products. Small reservoirs in the Quixaba Creek Basin were identified based on their topographic characteristics. Given that the small reservoirs are “depressions” in the terrain, they can be “filled”, resulting in a new Digital Terrain Model (DTM). The difference between the filled DTM and the original DTM makes it possible to identify the reservoirs. A summary of the results is: 61 reservoirs were correctly detected; 18 reservoirs were not detected; 13 reservoirs were detected erroneously. In another application, the storage capacity of the reservoirs belonging to the hydrosystems of Paje{\'{u}} River Basin was estimated. The storage in these reservoirs and maximum surface area were estimated using DTM and geoprocessing tools. From the total of 31 reservoirs evaluated, eight were completely empty at the time of the LiDAR data collection. The official registers reported 83.83 million m3 for the storage capacity of these eight reservoirs, whereas our applications estimated the value at 70.23 million m3. This difference is explained by the loss of volume in the reservoirs due to the process of sediment transport.RESUMO Este artigo apresenta a aplica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de produtos adquiridos por levantamento a{\'{e}}reo para caracteriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de reservat{\'{o}}rios de abastecimento de {\'{a}}gua na Bacia do Rio Paje{\'{u}} (Pernambuco/Brasil).

Small reservoirs may impact on large-scale water availability both by enhancing availability in a distributed sense and by subtracting water for large downstream user communities, e.g. served by large reservoirs. Both of these impacts of small reservoirs are subject to climate change. Using a case-study on North-East Brazil, this paper shows that climate change impacts on water availability may be severe, and impacts on distributed water availability from small reservoirs may exceed impacts on centralised water availability from large reservoirs.

In this study, the geometry and volume of small surface reservoirs in the semi-arid region of Brazil were estimated using terrain and shape attributes extracted by remote sensing. Regression models and data classification were used to predict the volumes, at different water stages, of 312 reservoirs for which topographic information is available. The power function used to describe the reservoir shapes tends to overestimate the volumes; therefore, a modified shape equation was proposed. Among the methods tested, four were recommended based on performance and simplicity, for which the mean absolute percentage errors varied from 24 to 39%, in contrast to the 94% error achieved with the traditional method. Despite the challenge of precisely deriving the flooded areas of reservoirs, water management in highly reservoir-dense environments should benefit from volume prediction based on remote sensing.},

abstract = {Semi-arid areas are characterized by small water resources. An increasing water demand due to population growth and economic development as well as a possible decreasing water availability in the course of climate change may aggravate water scarcity in future in these areas. The quantitative assessment of the water resources is a prerequisite for the development of sustainable measures of water management. For this task, hydrological models within a dynamic integrated framework are indispensable tools. The main objective of this study is to develop a hydrological model for the quantification of water availability over a large geographic domain of semi-arid environments. The study area is the Federal State of Cear{\'{a}} in the semi-arid north-east of Brazil. Surface water from reservoirs provides the largest part of water supply. The area has recurrently been affected by droughts which caused serious economic losses and social impacts like migration from the rural regions. The hydrological model WASA (Model of Water Availability in Semi-Arid Environments) developed in this study is a deterministic, spatially distributed model. Water availability is determined in terms of river discharge, storage volumes in reservoirs and soil moisture. Specific model formulations applicable for hydrological processes under semi-arid conditions are used. Temporal and spatial scaling approaches are applied to link the process scales with the scales of interest for model application. Modelling units are defined by similarity of landscape characteristics with regard to both lateral and vertical hydrological processes. Model applications of WASA generally result in a good model performance when compared to observed historical time series of river discharge and reservoir storage volumes. An appropriate process representation is shown to be the basis for reliable simulation results. However, the results are characterized by large uncertainties, mainly due to uncertainties of the input data in view of the low data availability. This refers in particular to rainfall data and soil parameters. Results of model simulations for climate scenarios until the year 2050 show that a possible future change in precipitation volumes causes a larger percentage change in runoff volumes by a factor of two to three. In the case of a decreasing precipitation trend, the efficiency of new reservoirs for securing water availability tends to decrease in the study area because of the interaction of the large number of reservoirs in retaining the overall decreasing runoff volumes.},

abstract = {Taking into account the climatic conditions of the semiarid region of Brazil, with its intermittent rivers and long periods of water scarcity, a dense network of surface reservoirs (on average one dam every 5 km2) of very different sizes has been built. The impact of such a network on water and sediment dynamics constitutes a remarkable challenge for hydrologists. The main objective of this work is to present a novel way of simulating water and sediment fluxes through such high-density reservoir networks, which enables the assessment of water and sediment retention in those structures. The new reservoir modeling approach has been coupled with the fully process-oriented and semidistributed hydrological WASA-SED model, which was tailored for semiarid hydroclimatological characteristics. This integrated modeling system was applied to the 933-km2 Bengu{\^{e}} catchment, located in semiarid northeastern Brazil, which has a network of 114 reservoirs with a wide range of surface areas (from 0.003 to 350 ha). The small reservoirs were grouped into size classes according to their storage capacity and a cascade routing scheme was applied to describe the upstream-downstream position of the classes; the large reservoirs were handled explicitly in the reservoir modeling approach. According to the model results, the proposed approach is capable of representing the water and sediment fluxes though the entire reservoir network with reasonable accuracy. In addition, the model shows that the dynamics of water and sediment within the Bengu{\^{e}} catchment are strongly impacted by the presence of multiple reservoirs, which are able to retain approximately 21% of the generated runoff and almost 42% of the sediment yield of the catchment for the simulation period, from 2000 to 2012.},

abstract = {Purpose: To support scientifically sound water management in dryland environments a modelling system has been developed for the quantitative assessment of water and sediment fluxes in catchments, transport in the river system, and retention in reservoirs. The spatial scale of interest is the mesoscale because this is the scale most relevant for management of water and land resources.
Materials and methods: This modelling system comprises process-oriented hydrological components tailored for dryland characteristics coupled with components comprising hillslope erosion, sediment transport and reservoir deposition processes. The spatial discretization is hierarchically designed according to a multi-scale concept to account for particular relevant process scales. The non-linear and partly intermittent run-off generation and sediment dynamics are dealt with by accounting for connectivity phenomena at the intersections of landscape compartments. The modelling system has been developed by means of data from nested research catchments in NE-Spain and in NE-Brazil.
Results and discussion: In the semi-arid NE of Brazil sediment retention along the topography is the main process for sediment retention at all scales, i.e. the sediment delivery is transport limited. This kind of deposition retains roughly 50 to 60 % of eroded sediment, maintaining a similar deposition proportion in all spatial scales investigated. On the other hand, the sediment retained in reservoirs is clearly related to the scale, increasing with catchment area. With increasing area, there are more reservoirs, increasing the possibility of deposition. Furthermore, the area increase also promotes an increase in flow volume, favouring the construction of larger reservoirs, which generally overflow less frequently and retain higher sediment fractions. The second example comprises a highly dynamic Mediterranean catchment in NE-Spain with nested sub-catchments and reveals the full dynamics of hydrological, erosion and deposition features. The run-off modelling performed well with only some overestimation during low-flow periods due to the neglect of water losses along the river. The simulated peaks in sediment flux are reproduced well, while low-flow sediment transport is less well captured, due to the disregard of sediment remobilization in the riverbed during low flow.
Conclusions: This combined observation and modelling study deepened the understanding of hydro-sedimentological systems characterized by flashy run-off generation and by erosion and sediment transport pulses through the different landscape compartments. The connectivity between the different landscape compartments plays a very relevant role, regarding both the total mass of water and sediment transport and the transport time through the catchment.},

The procedure involved a public consultation through online media, followed by two workshops through which a large number of potential science questions were collated, prioritised, and synthesised. In spite of the diversity of the participants (230 scientists in total), the process revealed much about community priorities and the state of our science: a preference for continuity in research questions rather than radical departures or redirections from past and current work. Questions remain focused on the process-based understanding of hydrological variability and causality at all space and time scales. Increased attention to environmental change drives a new emphasis on understanding how change propagates across interfaces within the hydrological system and across disciplinary boundaries. In particular, the expansion of the human footprint raises a new set of questions related to human interactions with nature and water cycle feedbacks in the context of complex water management problems. We hope that this reflection and synthesis of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology will help guide research efforts for some years to come.},

abstract = {Water resources in dryland areas are often provided by numerous surface reservoirs. As a basis for securing future water supply, the dynamics of reservoir systems need to be simulated for large river basins, accounting for environmental change and an increasing water demand. For the State of Ceara in semiarid Northeast Brazil, with several thousands of reservoirs, a simple deterministic water balance model is presented. Within a cascade-type approach, the reservoirs are grouped into six classes according to storage capacity, rules for flow routing between reservoirs of different size are defined, and water withdrawal and return flow due to human water use is accounted for. While large uncertainties in model applications exist, particularly in terms of reservoir operation rules, model validation against observed reservoir storage volumes shows that the approach is a reasonable simplification to assess surface water availability in large river basins. The results demonstrate the large impact of reservoir storage on downstream flow and stress the need for a coupled simulation of runoff generation, network redistribution and water use.},

abstract = {This study investigated the sensitivity of a dynamic downscaling atmospheric model system coupled with a rainfall-runoff model to hindcast an example of reservoir water management in the semi-arid region of Northeast Brazil (NEB). A regional atmospheric spectral model (RSM) is driven by the outputs of an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM), itself forced by the observed sea surface temperature over the World Ocean. Daily precipitation simulated by the RSM was then used as the input to a hydrological rainfall-runoff model for the Upper Jaguaribe River Basin to estimate inflows at the Or{\'{o}}s Reservoir in the state of Cear{\'{a}}. A hindcast analysis of precipitation was performed during the rainy season over NEB (January to June) from 1971 to 2000. The RSM captured the precipitation variability relatively well when a probability density function (PDF) was used to correct the numerical bias. Three hindcast series of inflow using (i) the observed rainfall, (ii) the simulated rainfall before the PDF correction, and (iii) the simulated rainfall after the PDF correction were performed during the study period and then compared to the series of observed inflow. The atmospheric-rainfall-runoff "cascade" model efficiency was evaluated by comparing the Or{\'{o}}s Reservoir release decisions from different scenarios based on observed, simulated (RSM, RSM-PDF), and mean historical reservoir inflows. The cascade model has the potential, relatively well balanced during dry, normal or wet years, to be a useful tool to correctly forecast the decision managements of reservoirs in the semi-arid region of NEB. Additional progress in the numerical simulation is however necessary to improve the performance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {In the last years, hundreds of small reservoirs were built in the Savannah regions of Brazil and Ghana. They play an important role in supporting the local economies. The lack of technical information about the small reservoirs in these regions is endangering the sustainability of agriculture and the livelihood of farmers. The purpose of this study was to establish the volume-area-depth relationship for small reservoirs in the Brazilian and Ghana Savannah regions. Thus, a comprehensive field work was performed. In total, 28.5% and 39.0% of the total number of small reservoirs in the Preto River Basin in Brazil and in the Upper East Region of Ghana, respectively, were visited and measured. The results showed a good-fit for the depth-volume and area-volume relationships for both regions, with coefficient of determination, for both cases and both regions, higher than 0.93. The mean k and $\alpha$1 values were lower in Brazil as compared to Ghana and k1 and $\alpha$ were higher. The values of the parameters presented great variability, indicating the importance of performing local measurements.},

abstract = {In many places in the world, increasing water demands have led to the development of infrastructure for freshwater storage and irrigation. Especially in water-scarce regions, this development has led to a growing number of concerns about basin closure. These concerns ask for a structured approach for analyzing the occurrence of basin closure to facilitate sustainable responses. In this paper, the downstreamness concept is proposed for analyzing the availability and commitments of freshwater in river basins. The downstreamness of a location is the ratio of its upstream catchment area to the entire river basin area. The downstreamness of a function on the basin, such as water availability or water demand, is defined as the downstreamness-weighted integral of that function divided by its regular integral. An approach to determine the downstreamness of surface water storage capacity, stored surface water volumes, and water demands is described. Applying the proposed approach is helpful for the spatiotemporally explicit assessment of basin closure and its drivers. Water management policies rely on the valuations of trade-offs between commitments of upstream and downstream uses and technical implementations of upstream and downstream measures. The concept of downstreamness can assist in analyzing subbasin points of view as an integral part of a basin perspective. In this way, the effects of anthropogenic processes driving basin closure can be better understood. To illustrate the use of the concept, the authors describe its application to the Jaguaribe Basin in the semiarid northeast of Brazil. ? 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {To effectively manage hydrological drought, there is an urgent need to better understand and evaluate its human drivers. Using the “downstreamness” concept, we assess the role of a reservoir network in the emergence and evolution of droughts in a river basin in Brazil. In our case study, the downstreamness concept shows the effect of a network of reservoirs on the spatial distribution of stored surface water volumes over time. We demonstrate that, as a consequence of meteorological drought and recovery, the distribution of stored volumes became spatially skewed towards upstream locations, which affected the duration and magnitude of hydrological drought both upstream (where drought was alleviated) and downstream (where drought was aggravated). The downstreamness concept thus appears to be a useful entry point for spatiotemporally explicit assessments of hydrological drought and for determining the likelihood of progression from meteorological drought to a human-modified hydrological drought in a basin.},

abstract = {Socio-economic costs of drought are progressively increasing worldwide due to undergoing alterations of hydro-meteorological regimes induced by climate change. Although drought management is largely studied in the literature, traditional drought indexes often fail at detecting critical events in highly regulated systems, where natural water availability is conditioned by the operation of water infrastructures such as dams, diversions, and pumping wells. Here, ad hoc index formulations are usually adopted based on empirical combinations of several, supposed-to-be significant, hydro-meteorological variables. These customized formulations, however, while effective in the design basin, can hardly be generalized and transferred to different contexts. In this study, we contribute FRIDA (FRamework for Index-based Drought Analysis), a novel framework for the automatic design of basin-customized drought indexes. In contrast to ad hoc empirical approaches, FRIDA is fully automated, generalizable, and portable across different basins. FRIDA builds an index representing a surrogate of the drought conditions of the basin, computed by combining all the relevant available information about the water circulating in the system identified by means of a feature extraction algorithm. We used the Wrapper for Quasi-Equally Informative Subset Selection (W-QEISS), which features a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to find Pareto-efficient subsets of variables by maximizing the wrapper accuracy, minimizing the number of selected variables, and optimizing relevance and redundancy of the subset. The preferred variable subset is selected among the efficient solutions and used to formulate the final index according to alternative model structures. We apply FRIDA to the case study of the Jucar river basin (Spain), a drought-prone and highly regulated Mediterranean water resource system, where an advanced drought management plan relying on the formulation of an ad hoc "state index" is used for triggering drought management measures. The state index was constructed empirically with a trial-and-error process begun in the 1980s and finalized in 2007, guided by the experts from the Confederaci{\'{o}}n Hidrogr{\'{a}}fica del J{\'{u}}car (CHJ). Our results show that the automated variable selection outcomes align with CHJ's 25-year-long empirical refinement. In addition, the resultant FRIDA index outperforms the official State Index in terms of accuracy in reproducing the target variable and cardinality of the selected inputs set.},

abstract = {Historically, during periods of extreme drought, food security in the drylands of the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil (NEB) is under severe risk due to agricultural collapse. The drought that started in 2012 continues to highlight the vulnerability of this region, and arid conditions have been detected during the last years mainly in the central semiarid region, covering almost 2% of the NEB. Climate projections show an increase in the area under water stress condition, covering 49% and 54% of the NEB region by 2700 and 2100, respectively, with a higher likelihood with warming above 4 °C. The projections of vegetative stress conditions derived from the empirical model for Vegetation Health Index (VHI) are consistent with projections from vegetation models, where semi-desert types typical of arid conditions would replace the current semiarid bushland vegetation (“caatinga”) by 2100. Due to the impacts of the 2012–2017 drought, public policies have been implemented to reduce social and economic vulnerability for small farmers but are not enough as poor population continues to be affected. In the long term, to make the semiarid less vulnerable to drought, strengthened integrated water resources management and a proactive drought policy are needed to restructure the economy. Integrating drought monitoring and seasonal climate forecasting provides means of assessing impacts of climate variability and change, leading to disaster risk reduction through early warning. Lastly, there is an urgent need for integrated assessments because the possibility that under permanent drought conditions with warming above 4 °C, arid conditions would prevail in NEB since 2060.},

abstract = {This study discusses the climatological aspects of the most severe drought ever recorded in the semiarid region Northeast Brazil. Droughts are recurrent in the region and while El Nino has driven some of these events others are more dependent on the tropical North Atlantic sea surface temperature fields. The drought affecting this region during the last 5 years shows an intensity and impact not seen in several decades in the regional economy and society. The analysis of this event using drought indicators as well as meteorological fields shows that since the middle 1990s to 2016, 16 out of 25 years experienced rainfall below normal. This suggests that the recent drought may have in fact started in the middle-late 1990s, with the intense droughts of 1993 and 1998, and then the sequence of dry years (interrupted by relatively wet years in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2011) after that may have affected the levels of reservoirs in the region, leading to a real water crisis that was magnified by the negative rainfall anomalies since 2010.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to investigate the relationship between soil water content and rainfall with rice, beans, cassava and corn yields in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil. Precipitation and modeled soil water content were compared to yields recorded at the county levels in this region. The results were also integrated over the area of the nine States that lie within the officially recognized region of semiarid climate in Brazil. The influence of water balance components was quantified by calculating their correlation coefficient with yields of the different crop species over the municipalities of the region. It was found that rainfall had higher correlation to crop yields over most of the region, while soil water content had lower values of correlation. This result is consistent with the fact that average root depth is 40 cm, lower than the layer of soil used in the model used to estimate soil water content (100 cm). Plants respond better to the precipitation in the top layers of soil, while the water storage in the deep layer of soil might be important only in other temporal and spatial scales of the hydrological cycle.},

abstract = {There is strong evidence that climate change will increase drought risk and severity, but these conclusions depend on the regions, seasons, and drought metrics being considered. We analyze changes in drought across the hydrologic cycle (precipitation, soil moisture, and runoff) in projections from Phase Six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The multimodel ensemble shows robust drying in the mean state across many regions and metrics by the end of the 21st century, even following the more aggressive mitigation pathways (SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5). Regional hotspots with strong drying include western North America, Central America, Europe and the Mediterranean, the Amazon, southern Africa, China, Southeast Asia, and Australia. Compared to SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, however, the severity of drying in the lower warming scenarios is substantially reduced and further precipitation declines in many regions are avoided. Along with drying in the mean state, the risk of the historically most extreme drought events also increases with warming, by 200–300% in some regions. Soil moisture and runoff drying in CMIP6 is more robust, spatially extensive, and severe than precipitation, indicating an important role for other temperature-sensitive drought processes, including evapotranspiration and snow. Given the similarity in drought responses between CMIP5 and CMIP6, we speculate that both generations of models are subject to similar uncertainties, including vegetation processes, model representations of precipitation, and the degree to which model responses to warming are consistent with observations. These topics should be further explored to evaluate whether CMIP6 models offer reasons to have increased confidence in drought projections.},
