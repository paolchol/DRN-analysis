# Figure generation
## Figure 1
Map of the study area localization on the left. Centralized reservoirs visualization and density representation of the DRN on the right.
Made in QGIS for now. A code can be written by loading the shapefiles used there.

## Figure 2
Comparison between the modelled and observed volumes of the reservoirs.
### Version 1
*Line graph of Arrojado Lisboa modelled vs observed volumes*

### Version 2 
*Scatterplot of modelled vs observed volumes. Arrojado Lisboa, Pedras Brancas, Fogareiro*

## Figure 3
Graphical representation of the Drought Cycle Analysis, from Ribeiro Neto et al., 2022.
